Most GPS enabled devices report altitude, but did not work Android Samsung S3, on iPhone works well.
<p>As I check my settings there are three:
<ol>
<li> High Accuracy: Uses GPS, Wifi, and mobile networks to estimate your location.
<li> Power Saving: Uses Wifi and mobile networks to estimate your location.
<li> GPS Only: Users GPS to estimate your location.
</ol>
<p>Reading <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/Web-Developer-Class-HTML5-Geolocation-3917596.htm#fbid=gr4qaceB9Js">more from this article:</a>

<blockquote>"Most GPS enabled devices are capable of reporting altitude but non-GPS methods such as cell triangulation can not report altitude... If the device does not support altitude information, the altitudeAccuracy property on the position object will be null."</blockquote>
